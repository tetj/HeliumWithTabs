# Helium With Tabs
This is a fork of [Helium](https://github.com/darklinkpower/Helium), it's a theme inspired by Steam and Plex.
This theme is for [Playnite](https://github.com/JosefNemec/Playnite) Desktop Mode.

## Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [releases](https://github.com/tetj/HeliumWithTabs/releases/)
2. Open the .pthm file

## Usage & features
Download instructions [here](https://github.com/tetj/BonusTools/raw/refs/heads/master/documentation/Playnite.docx)

## To do
1. I need to change the text "number of reviews" for "user score" depending on the user preference (number of reviews requires the BonusTools extension)
2. I need to translate a few labels
3. For more customization, stop relying on "Steam News and Players Viewer" extension to display the number of players in-game, it could be imported in the Version column to be sortable, it seems quite simple to get the info : https://api.steampowered.com/ISteamUserStats/GetNumberOfCurrentPlayers/v1/?appid=2322010
4. Display Genres in the Features/Tags tab
5. Move Links and HowLongToBeat to main tab (Video) ?
